# Welcome

gdsfactory provides you with a set of useful generic component templates to build your PDKs and send your masks to the foundry.

You just need to adapt the templates to your foundry (see pp/samples/pdk)

GDSII is the standard format to create masks sets in the CMOS industry.

Gdsfactory extends [phidl](https://github.com/amccaugh/phidl) and [gdspy](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy) with some useful photonics functions (see photonics package `pp`)

- define templates for basic components
- define component sweeps (Design of Experiments or DOEs) in YAML files
- route optical/electrical ports to pads and grating couplers

## Installation

If you are on Windows, you will need a C++ compiler - For Windows + Python 3, install the Microsoft ["Build Tools for Visual Studio"](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017)

Once you have `git` and `python3` copy-paste this 3 lines into a terminal (For windows use Git Bash)

```
git clone https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory
cd gdsfactory
bash install.sh
```

## Getting started

- [read Documentation](https://gdsfactory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
- run gdsfactory/pp/samples
- run gdsfactory/notebooks

## Testing

You may also invoke `pf test` at any time from the command line.

- runs functions that start with `test_function` in pp and tests folders

`the pre-commit hook` enables pre-commit hook check syntax with flake8

- Upon commit, `flake8` checks syntax/style and `black` autoformatts the code

## Gdslib


There is a second software package with a default component library of locked components: gdslib.
These components are generated by the component factories listed in `component_type2factory` in `pp/components/__init__py`.

If any component of the core library changes as a result of a modification, `pf library test` raises an error.
You may check whether the change is wanted by inspecting the gds files, or using gdsdiff.

If the component modification is correct, the library has to be relocked with the new GDS file and its new hash.

This is done by manually calling the function `test_factory.py` or by manually replacing the component GDS file in `gdslib`.
Always invoke this function with care: all the components modified by this function become the new standards.
`test_factory` compares GDShash of the library with the gdslib repo, you can relock the library

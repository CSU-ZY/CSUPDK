The bend's handle is the point of intersetion of it's inverted port vectors (i.e. if the ports were pointed inwards rather than outwards). For any arbitrary bend, this guarantees that the ports of the bend will be in the straight line of sight of the ports which they should connect to, inset by some amount.\n",

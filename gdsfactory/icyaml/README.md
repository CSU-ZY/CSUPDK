# ICYAML

Webapp to visualize in real time gdsfactory netlists.

To read more about gdsfactory netlist format you can take a look a the netlist driven flows [docs](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/notebooks/07_yaml_component.html)

The idea is that you have klayout open in one panel and the webapp in the other window, and you can see the circuit live changes.

Then save the circuit with `.ic.yaml` extension.

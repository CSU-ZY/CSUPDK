# FIXME

Here are some corner cases with unclear solution.

If you have any ideas / suggestions on how to fix them, feel free to submit a PR.


For example.

- what to do with impossible routes?
- how can we enable optimization of routes?
- how can we enable multilayer routing using different metal levels

# # YAML Place and AutoRoute
#
# You have two options for working with gdsfactory:
#
# 1. **python flow**: you define your layout using python functions (Parametric Cells), and connect them with routing functions.
# 2. **YAML Place and AutoRoute**: you define your Component  as Place and Route in YAML. From the netlist you can simulate the Component or generate the layout.
#
#
# YAML is a human readable version of JSON that you can use to define placements and routes
#
# to define a a YAML Component you need to define:
#
# - instances: with each instance setting
# - placements: with X and Y
#
# And optionally:
#
# - routes: between instance ports
# - connections: to connect instance ports to other ports (without routes)
# - ports: define input and output ports for the top level Component.
#
#
# gdsfactory VSCode extension has a filewatcher for `*.pic.yml` files that will show them live in klayout as you edit them.
#
# ![extension](https://i.imgur.com/89OPCQ1.png)
#
# The extension provides you with useful code snippets and filewatcher extension to see live modifications of `*pic.yml` or `*.py` files. Look for the telescope button on the top right of VSCode ðŸ”­.

# ```YAML
#
# routes:
#     route_name:
#         links:
#             instance_source,port: instance_destination,port
#         settings:  # for the route (optional)

# ## instances, placements, connections, ports, routes
#
# Lets combine all you learned so far.
#
# You can define the netlist connections of a component by a netlist in YAML format
#
# Note that you define the connections as `instance_source.port ->
# instance_destination.port` so the order is important and therefore you can only
# change the position of the `instance_destination`

# You can define several routes that will be connected using `gf.routing.get_bundle`

# In general, the jinja-yaml parser has a superset of the functionalities and syntax of the standard yaml parser. The one notable exception is with `settings`. When reading any yaml files with `settings` blocks, the default settings will be read and applied, but they will not be settable, as the jinja parser has a different mechanism for setting injection with the `default_settings` block and jinja2.

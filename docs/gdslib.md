# gdslib

the library is in a separate [repo](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdslib) with examples for component models.

A component circuit model returns Sparameters for different settings.

If the model is not good valid for your component you can create your own model with FDTD simulations. (see Sparameters jupyter notebook)

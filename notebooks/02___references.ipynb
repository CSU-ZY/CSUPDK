    "does not contain any geometry. It only *points* to an existing geometry**.  That\n",
    "still might not be clear, so let's use an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say Alice has a ridiculously large polygon with 100 billion vertices in it that\n",
    "we'll call BigPolygon.  It's huge, but she needs to use it in her design 250\n",
    "times.  Well, a single copy of BigPolygon takes up 100GB of memory just by\n",
    "itself, so she doesn't want to make 250 copies of it. Since Alice is clever, she\n",
    "instead *references* the polygon 250 times.  Each reference only uses a few\n",
    "bytes of memory -- it only needs to know the memory address of BigPolygon and a\n",
    "few other things. In this way, she can keep one copy of BigPolygon and use it\n",

    "# DEVSIM circuit simulator (experimental)\n",
    "\n",
    "[DEVSIM](https://devsim.org/) is an open-source semiconductor device simulator; also see [publication](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03898). \n",
    "\n",
    "It compares in solving capabilities for propietary tools. Some of its features include:\n",
    "* Sharfetter-Gummel discretization of the electron and hole continuity equations\n",
    "* DC, transient, small-signal AC, and noise solution algorithms\n",
    "* Solution of 1D, 2D, and 3D unstructured meshes\n",
    "* Advanced models for mobility and semiclassical approaches for quantum effects\n",
    "In addition, it operates with a symbolic model evaluation interface, easily allowing new models and their derivatives to be scripted.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an active community over at the [DEVSIM forums](https://forum.devsim.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meshing\n",
    "\n",
    "DEVSIM solves equations on unstructured meshes. It has a built-in 1D and 2D meshing interface, currently used in gdsfactory to solve for carrier distributions in waveguide cross-sections. It also interfaces with GMSH for arbitrary 2D and 3D meshes, which we will use in the future to perform semiconductor simulations of gdsfactory components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing DEVSIM and visualization dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the below notebook, you will need to install DEVSIM in your notebook's Python environment. The easiest way to do so is to [download the binary from Github](https://github.com/devsim/devsim/releases), unzip, and `pip install` the package. There are also dependencies to load and display mesh files. For the simplest install, you will need to use `conda` (`mamba` for speed) instead of `pip` to get the binaries for `vtk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example on Ubuntu (you may need to restart your notebook after running this cell)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fresh conda environment on Ubuntu, I am able to run this notebook after running the following commands:"

Now that you have installed gdsfactory lets create your first component.

You'll need to keep 3 windows open:

- A text editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Spyder, neovim, Atom, Jupyterlab ...)
- A python / Ipython terminal / jupyter notebook (interactive python to run).
- Klayout to Visualize the GDS files.

# Component

A Component contains:

- a list of elements
  - add_polygon
    - boundary: defines the area inside a shape's points (requires shape and layer)
    - path: defines a line with a certain width combining a shapeâ€™s points (requires shape, layer and a line_width)
  - add_ref (single reference)
  - add_array (array of references)
- a dictionary of ports
  - add_port(): adds a port to the dictionary
- convenient methods:
  - write_gds(): saves to GDS

The first thing to learn about is how to create a new component.
We do that by creating a function which returns a Component instance.
Here is a step by step example below generating a waveguide crossing

```eval_rst

.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import gdsfactory as gf


    @gf.cell
    def crossing_arm(wg_width=0.5, r1=3.0, r2=1.1, w=1.2, L=3.4):
        c = gf.Component()

        # We need an ellipse, this is an existing primitive
        c << gf.components.ellipse(radii=(r1, r2), layer=gf.LAYER.SLAB150)

        a = L + w / 2
        h = wg_width / 2

        # Generate a polygon from scratch
        taper_pts = [
            (-a, h),
            (-w / 2, w / 2),
            (w / 2, w / 2),
            (a, h),
            (a, -h),
            (w / 2, -w / 2),
            (-w / 2, -w / 2),
            (-a, -h),
        ]

        # Add the polygon to the component on a specific layer
        c.add_polygon(taper_pts, layer=gf.LAYER.WG)

        # Add ports (more on that later)
        c.add_port(
            name='o1', midpoint=(-a, 0), orientation=180, width=wg_width, layer=gf.LAYER.WG
        )
        c.add_port(
            name='o2', midpoint=(a, 0), orientation=0, width=wg_width, layer=gf.LAYER.WG
        )
        return c


    @gf.cell  # This decorator will generate a unique name for the component
    def crossing():
        c = gf.Component()
        arm = crossing_arm()

        # Create two arm references. One has a 90Deg rotation
        arm_h = arm.ref(position=(0, 0))
        arm_v = arm.ref(position=(0, 0), rotation=90)

        # Add each arm to the component
        # Also add the ports
        port_id = 0
        for ref in [arm_h, arm_v]:
            c.add(ref)
            for p in c.ports.values():
                # Here we don't care too much about the name we give to the ports
                # since they can be renamed. We just want the names to be unique
                c.add_port(name="{}".format(port_id), port=p)
                port_id += 1

        c.auto_rename_ports()
        return c


    c = crossing()
    c.plot()

```

## Types

What are the common data types?

```eval_rst
.. automodule:: gdsfactory.types
```

## Layers

Each foundry uses different GDS numbers for each process step.

We follow the generic layer numbers from the book "Silicon Photonics Design: From Devices to Systems Lukas Chrostowski, Michael Hochberg".

| GDS (layer, purpose) | layer_name | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

| 2 , 0                | SLAB150    | 150nm Silicon slab (70nm shallow Etch for grating couplers) |
| 3 , 0                | SLAB90     | 90nm Silicon slab (for modulators)                          |
| 4, 0                 | DEEPTRENCH | Deep trench                                                 |
| 47, 0                | MH         | heater                                                      |
| 41, 0                | M1         | metal 1                                                     |
| 45, 0                | M2         | metal 2                                                     |
| 40, 0                | VIAC       | VIAC to contact Ge, NPP or PPP                              |

| 46, 0                | PADOPEN    | Bond pad opening                                            |
| 51, 0                | UNDERCUT   | Undercut                                                    |
| 66, 0                | TEXT       | Text markup                                                 |
| 64, 0                | FLOORPLAN  | Mask floorplan                                              |

Layers are available in `gf.LAYER` as `gf.LAYER.WG`, `gf.LAYER.WGCLAD`

You can build PDKs for different foundries. The PDKs contain some foundry IP such as layer numbers, minimum CD, layer stack, so you need to keep them in a separate private repo. See [UBC PDK](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ubc) as an example.

I recommend that you create the PDK repo using a cookiecutter template. For example, you can use this one.

```
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/joamatab/cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal
```

Or you can fork the UBC PDK and create new cell functions that use the correct layers for your foundry. For example.

```

import dataclasses
import gdsfactory as gf


@dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True)
class Layer:
    WGCORE = (3, 0)
    LABEL = (100, 0)


LAYER = Layer()


```

## Port

You can define ports to:

- facilitate positioning of components with respect to one another
- connect components between each other using routing sub-routines
- find ports by a particular layer or port name prefix

```eval_rst
.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import gdsfactory as gf

    y = 0.5
    x = 2
    layer = (1, 0) # a GDS layer is a tuple of 2 integers
    c = gf.Component()
    c.add_polygon([(0, 0), (x, 0), (x, y), (0, y)], layer=layer)
    c.add_port(name='o1', midpoint=(0, y/2), width=y, orientation=180, layer=layer)
    c.plot()

```

```eval_rst
.. plot::
    :include-source:

    import gdsfactory as gf

    coupler = gf.components.coupler()
    c = gf.Component()

    # Instantiate a reference to `_cpl`, positioning 'o1' port at coords (0, 0)
    coupler1 = coupler.ref(port_id='o1', position=(0, 0))

    # Instantiate another reference to `_cpl`, positioning 'o1' port at
    # the position of the 'E0' port from cpl1
    coupler2 = coupler.ref(port_id='o1', position=coupler1.ports['o4'].position)

    c.add(coupler1)
    c.add(coupler2)

    # add the ports of the child cells into the parent cell
    c.add_port(port=coupler1.ports['o1'])
    c.add_port(port=coupler1.ports['o2'])
    c.add_port(port=coupler2.ports['o4'])
    c.add_port(port=coupler2.ports['o3'])
    c.plot()

```

`Component.ref()` also accepts:

- `h_mirror` (True / False),
- `v_mirror` (True / False)
- `rotation` (0 / 90 / 180 / 270)

They implement the transformation with respect to the port position given by port_id.
If no port_id is given, transformation is done with respect to (0,0)

Ports can have flexible labelling and by default, the user chooses how to label the ports
in the component with the constraint of giving name unique names within this component.

A function `auto_rename_ports` is provided to automatically label ports clockwise (starting from bottom, left corner):

- optical ports start from bottom left corner and have a `o` prefix ('o1', 'o2' ...)
- electrical ports start from bottom left corner and have a `e` prefix ('e1', 'e2' ...)

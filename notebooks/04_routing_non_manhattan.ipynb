    "### Summary of available parameters\n",
    "We went through many examples above. Here is a quick recap of the parameters we used for the all-angle router.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top-level settings\n",
    "These settings can be used in the bundle's top-level `settings` block and will be applied to the whole bundle, unless overridden by an individual segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Function |\n",
    "| :-- | :-- |\n",
    "| start_angle | Defines the starting angle of the route (attaches a bend to the starting port to exit at that angle) |\n",
    "| end_angle | Defines the angle leaving the end port of the route (attaches a bend to the end port to exit at that angle) |\n",
    "| bend | The default component to use for the bends |\n",
    "| cross_section | This cross-section will be passed to the bends and the straight connectors. However, these functions can use this information as they like (i.e. an auto-taper connector will attempt to taper to the cross-section but a low-loss connector may ignore it |\n",
    "| end_connector | Specifies the connector to use for the final straight segment of the route |\n",
    "| end_cross_section| Specifies the cross-section to use for the final straight segment of the route |\n",
    "| separation | (bundle only) Specifies the separation between adjacent routes. If `None`, it will query each segment's cross-section for the appropriate default value |\n",
    "| steps | A set of directives for custom routing. This is expected to be a list of dictionaries with parameters per step as defined below |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step directives\n",
    "These settings can be defined within individual steps to control the direction of each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that an error will be thrown if a step is overconstrained. For example, `x` and `y` can be defined together in a single step *only if* `exit_angle` is not defined in the previous step. If `exit_angle` is defined (or angle is otherwise constrained by the port before it), you can only define *one* of x, y, ds, dx, or dy.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Function |\n",
    "| :-- | :-- |\n",
    "| x | Route to the given x coordinate (absolute) |\n",
    "| y | Route to the given y coordinate (absolute) |\n",
    "| ds | Proceed in the current orientation by this distance |\n",
    "| dx | The x-component of distance traveled should be this value |\n",
    "| dy | The y-component of distance traveled should be this value |\n",
    "| exit_angle | After this segment, place a bend to exit with this angle (degrees) |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step customizations\n",
    "These settings can also be set on individual steps to customize the route in that segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Function |\n",
    "| :-- | :-- |\n",
    "| cross_section | Use this cross-section for this segment. Will fall back to an auto-taper connector by default if this is specified alone, without `connector`.\n",
    "| connector | Use this connector for this segment |\n",
    "| separation | (bundles only) The separation to use between routes of this segment |"
